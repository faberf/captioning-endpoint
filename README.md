# Feature Extraction Server

This server can accept various media as input and performs various AI tasks, such as image captioning. It features an extensible plugin system that allows new tasks and models to be easily added. The purpose of this server is to maintain a uniform input / output specification for each AI task, regardless of the specifics of the model used. This allows models to be swapped more easily.
